Schema is a way to define the structure of a document,
in this case, the structure of a JSON document.
Schema files should be organized in a way that makes it easy to find the schema for a given endpoint.
For example, if we have an endpoint /api/v1/users, the schema for that endpoint should be in a file called users.py.
